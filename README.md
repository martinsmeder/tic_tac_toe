A browser based game of tic tac toe against the computer. Choose between a dumb, strategic or unbeatable opponent! 

Some things I've learned:
* How to use JavaScript and CSS code to create animations
* How to work with factory functions
* How to work with the module pattern
* How to avoid global code by squeezing everything into either a factory or a module
* What closures are and what they're useful for
